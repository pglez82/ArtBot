IONIC 4, ANGULAR 7 AND CORDOVA

First we will verify that Node.js has been installed correctly for this we open an cmd console and run the
following command:	

	$ node -v
	
Verify the version of the NPM package manager installed, for this using the open console we execute the command:

	$ npm -v

To install it we go to the official website of Node.js and download the latest version for our operating system:

	$ https://nodejs.org/en/

To install ionic globally:

	$ npm install -g ionic
	$ npm install ionic cordova -g
	
	$ ionic --version

To create a new Ionic 4 application, type this command in the terminal.
	
	$ ionic start myApp blank
	$ ionic start myApp tabs
	$ ionic start myApp sidemenu
	
	$ Install the free Ionic Appflow SDK and connect your app? (Y/n) N

We enter the folder of our project:

	$ cd myApp 
	
To run the app:

	$ ionic serve
	
Install and configure add-ons and dependencies:

	$ ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-camera
	$ npm install @ionic-native/camera
	
To run on Android devices, type this command while the device is connected.

	$ ionic cordova platform add android
	$ ionic cordova run android
	
What we can create automatically using ionic generator will be the following:

    components 
	$ ionic g component myComponent
    directives
	$ ionic g directive myDirective
    pages	
	$ ionic g page myPages
    services
	$ ionic g service api/user
    pipes
	$ ionic g pipe myPipe
	$ ionic g pipe pipes/safe --flat --spec=false

If we have problems with cordova plugins:

	$ cordova platform rm android
	$ cordova platform add android
	
If we have downloaded the app from a repository and want to add android or ios we must:

Just create a "www" directory in application root.

"./www" (can also do by this command- mkdir www)

Now we can easily run following command:

	$ cordova platform add android
	
GENERATE AND SIGN THE APK

We go from the console to the route of our project and use:

	$ ionic cordova build --release android		
	
Later we will go to Android Studio to finish generating our APK.
